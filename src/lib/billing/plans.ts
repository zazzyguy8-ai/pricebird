/**
 * What each plan costs and what it allows.
 *
 * The free tier is a lifetime allowance, not a monthly one. A monthly free
 * allowance is a subscription someone never pays for: a casual seller with
 * three items a month never hits it and never converts, while the reseller
 * this is built for burns five listings in an evening and decides on the spot.
 * Five is enough to see whether the output is good and not enough to run a
 * shop on.
 *
 * The paid cap exists to bound the model bill, not to upsell. At roughly two
 * cents of inference per listing, 300 a month is about six dollars against a
 * seven dollar price - which is the one number worth watching after the price
 * came down from nine. Nobody photographing items by hand gets near 300; the
 * cap is a runaway-script guard, and at this price it is also the line where
 * a single user would stop being profitable.
